# TextEditor

`SwiftUI`'s `Text` and `TextField` types have some issues displaying multiple lines. 

Once I filed the radars for this behavior I made a wrapper around UITextField that could unblock me, hope this helps anyone else out there!

## TODO

[ ] Apply inherited TextColor

[ ] Improve Font inheritance
